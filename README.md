Date Reminder (DR) is a web app to remind the important life events like Birthday, Wedding and Death of our beloved ones.
This app created to learn about EF 6, WCF, WebAPI and Angular.

Some of the frame work /code are borrowed from Miguel Castro's Pluralsight course  Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications
